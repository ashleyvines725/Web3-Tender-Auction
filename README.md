SMART TENDER AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING BLOCKCHAIN.

Procurement Tender and Auction Processes Characterise My Project Strenght.

The smart contract permits users to create and bid for Tenders. It also intend to facilitate an auction process for a specific item or asset.
For procurement, the bidding process is typically used to select a supplier or a contractor to provide goods or service. The bidding process is used to obtain competitive offers from potential supplier or contractors, and the award is usually made to the supplier or contractor with bid that meets the necessary criteria .

For auction, only the highest bidder will make the payment. After the auction has ended and the highest bid has been determined, the highest bidder will be obligated to pay the amount they have bid. If the highest bidder fails to make the payment within the specified timeframe, they will forfeit their bid and the next highest bidder will be given the opportunity to make the payment...

FUNCTION, being where all the smart contract logics take place
...My project's Smart Contract provides functionalities for both procurement tender and auction.

The 'createBid()' function allows for bidding on a specific item or service, which characterises my auction project.

Also, the 'createTender()' function allows for the creation of a Tender for a specific item or service, which is characteristic of a Procurement Tender.

Furthermore, the 'payBid()' function allows the highest bidder to pay for the item or service they won in the auction, while the 'acceptBid()' function allows the tender creator to accept the bid that meets their requirements.
